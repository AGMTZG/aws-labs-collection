# AWS Labs Collection

This repository contains a **small but growing collection of hands-on AWS labs** focused on learning by doing.

The goal of this project is educational: provide **practical, reproducible exercises** that help developers understand AWS concepts by running them first and then understanding how they work.

## Current Labs

At the moment, this repository includes early-stage labs such as:

- **S3 Static Website Hosting**  
  Deploying a basic static website using Amazon S3.

- **S3 Bucket Versioning**  
  Understanding how versioning works and how it protects object data.

More labs will be added incrementally as they are refined and validated.

## Status

🚧 **Work in progress**

This repository is intentionally small for now.  
My current primary focus is maintaining and improving advanced Kubernetes scenarios on KillerCoda, while gradually expanding this AWS lab collection.

## Who This Is For

- Developers new to AWS who want hands-on experience
- Engineers who prefer learning by experimenting instead of reading theory only
- Students preparing for AWS or cloud-related certifications

## Disclaimer

These labs are for **learning and experimentation purposes only**.  
They are not intended to represent production-ready architectures.
